# CourseMaterialCrawler

I am tired of downloading all the course material one by one, that is time consuming and sometimes I forget which file I have downloaded or not

I have included [CSCI571- Web Technology](http://cs-server.usc.edu:45678/) and [CSCI402-Operating System](http://merlot.usc.edu/cs402-s16/)

#Running
```
python csci402.py
```

#Requirement
The code use python 2.7

List of external libraries I use:
1:[Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
2:[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)

#Notice
1:By running the code you understand that the latest username and password for the course website matches the one in the source code. Otherwise, it may fail.
2:I use Spring 2016 course website for CSCI-402, instructor may remove course material after semester ends.
